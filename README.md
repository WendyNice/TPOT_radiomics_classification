# TPOT_radiomics_classification

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited cardiomyopathy and characterized by unexplained myocardial hypertrophy and fibrotic change. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) has been regarded as the reference technique for identification of myocardial fibrosis 

An autoML pipeline was implemented using the Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) for 3 subgroups of binary classification: LGE (+) and LGE (-), LGE (-) and control, and HCM and control.
